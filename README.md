This Java program implements a simple number guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. It utilizes a Random object to generate the target number and a Scanner object to collect user input for guesses. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the random number, at which point they are notified of their success along with the number of attempts made. The code is concise and easy to understand, making it suitable for learners and enthusiasts interested in Java programming. It offers an interactive and entertaining experience for users to test their guessing skills. The source code is available on GitHub for sharing, collaboration, and further development.
